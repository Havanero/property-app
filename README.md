Beginings of a new app to sketch out how to structure a project based in Starlette and refine my understanding of ASGI. Currently this is mostly boilerplate but has:

- working alembic
- working sqlalchemy
- integration with structlog using contextvars
- example of a blueprint-like structure using a `Router` object.
- examples of custom ASGI middleware

```shell script
$ poetry shell
$ inv dev
```
